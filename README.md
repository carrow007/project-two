# project-two

project outline. The Api has two endpoints one for grabbing articles 
and one for grabbing sources(they have a wide array of sources you can grab
from). My goal is to allow the user to select one or muliptle sources via 
dropdown or radio buttons and also slecet whether they want to see most 
popular, top or latest. Once the user selects the options then the disired
results will appear on the page. 

Similar to the "wander App" I would like to display the information in cards on the page.
